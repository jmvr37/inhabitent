# Inhabitent Project

Inhabitent is the 4th project of the web/dev course at RED Academy. we started downloading the red starter theme and customizing the templates and partials. this project requires a lot of styling which improved my sass skills. we also learned to use wordpress.

## 1. Download me (don't clone me!)
